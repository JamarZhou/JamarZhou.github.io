        Hi! I'm a high school senior getting into photography. The photos in this gallery will 
        remain relatively random as I continue to try things and experiment to see what I like. 
        I don't like to tell others what they should get out of a photo, but most of the photos 
        at the top of the page will have some sort of meaning and I hope you will give them a 
        chance before moving on. Later photos will be mostly experimental or silly. Thanks for 
        your time. 
      </p>
